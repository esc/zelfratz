By default, zelfratz config files and cache are in ~/.zelfratz.

You will need to get an api-key from digital tunes:

http://www.digital-tunes.net/affiliates/new

Store this in the file:

~/.zelfratz/api-key

Now add artists and labels you like into the following two files:

~/.zelfratz/artists
~/.zelfratz/labels

You can now run zelfratz, it will query digital tunes, output the results to
stdout and store them in the file:

~/.zelfratz/cache

To receive daily updates,  i use the follwing script as a cronjob:

PATH-TO/zelfratz.py | mutt -s "daily updates " -e "set \
from=zelfratz@YOURDOMAIN.COM" -e "set realname=zelfratz" \
TARGETNAME@YOURDOMAIN.COM
